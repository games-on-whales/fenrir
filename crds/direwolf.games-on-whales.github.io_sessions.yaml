              A session refers to a certain user playing a specific game with a specific
              client. This object is meant to live for the duration of the user's session.

              A session is created in response to a user's /launch request.

              It is meant to be deleted by the session controller once the agent has reported
              that it is ended.

              A user can have multiple sessions active at a time, and even multiple copies
              of the same "game" if the underlying persistentVolumeClass supports it multiple
              binding.

              A session is created when moonlight calls /launch to launch a game.
